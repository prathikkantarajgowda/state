This project gathers US state-level population data by race, sex, slave-status, and age from years 1790 to the present. The data source is the decennial US census.
Unfortunately, the earlier census data does not contain all of the pertinent data, but by year 1830 we start to see race x sex x age data.

Here are the years for which we have collected all relevant data:
