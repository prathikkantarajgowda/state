This project gathers US state-level population data by race, sex, slave-status, 
and age from years 1790 to the present. The data is from the decennial 
census through NHGIS or ICPSR.

There is a source file for each decade in the code/ folder. At the top of each
file is documentation regarding the source of the data (NHGIS vs ICPSR) and any
missing data points (e.g., we might be missing sex data for slaves or granular
age ranges).
